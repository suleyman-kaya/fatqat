# fatqat
fatqat is a lightweight ground control station software for UAVs.

## Concepts:
i consider three diffrent concepts: core+equipments, modular concept, script-based concept.

### core+equipments concept

## To-Do ✅
1. complete core pieces of the software [✅]:
- connecting to a vehicle (✅)
- vehicle state and settings (✅) 
- taking off (✅)
- guiding and controlling copter (✅)
- missions (✅)

<br>

2. complete equipments of the software: [⏳]
- vehicle state (✅)
- simple goto (✅)
- guided movement and commands (✅)
- basic mission (✅)
- mission import/export (✅)
- drone delivery (✨)
- flight replay (✨)
- channel overrides (✨)
- missions list (✨)
- camera view / OpenCV window (✨)
- multiprocessing (✨)

3. create drone, vtol, plane, and fighter-uav patches [⏳]:
- drone gcs (✨)
- vtol gcs (✨)
- plane gcs (✨)
- fighter uav gcs (✨)

4. create a simulation branch [⏳]:
- drone simulation (✨)
- vtol simulation (✨)
- plane simulation (✨)
- fighter uav simulation (✨)

5. optimize whole repository [⏳]:
- optimize main branch (✨)
